# Teardown API Stub Generator

This project aims to provide a parser for the XML files at https://www.teardowngame.com/modding/api.xml

These files describe the available Lua API for mods.

The parser currently generates a stub file for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Teal, a typed dialect for Lua](https://github.com/teal-language/tl).
